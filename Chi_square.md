# Understanding Chi-square Test and Significance Levels

In a Chi-square test, the critical value is used to determine whether the observed data significantly deviates from the expected data under the null hypothesis. It acts as a threshold to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

The significance level (\(\alpha\)) in a Chi-square test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). It sets the threshold for determining whether the observed differences between expected and observed frequencies are statistically significant.

## Key Points about Significance Level:

1. **Threshold for Decision Making:**
   - The significance level establishes a critical value from the Chi-square distribution. If the Chi-square statistic exceeds this critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected.

2. **Common Significance Levels:**
   - **0.05 (5%):** This is the most commonly used significance level, implying a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.
   - **0.01 (1%):** This implies a stricter criterion with a 1% risk of a Type I error.
   - **0.10 (10%):** This is a more lenient criterion with a 10% risk of a Type I error.

3. **Choosing the Significance Level:**
   - The choice of \(\alpha\) depends on the context and consequences of making a Type I error. For example, in critical medical research, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be chosen to minimize the risk of false positives.

## Steps in a Chi-square Test:

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** Assumes no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Assumes a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.

2. **Calculate the Chi-square Statistic:**
   - The Chi-square statistic (\(\chi^2\)) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
     \]
     where \(O_i\) are the observed frequencies and \(E_i\) are the expected frequencies.

3. **Determine Degrees of Freedom:**
   - The degrees of freedom (df) for the test is typically the number of categories minus one (df = \(n - 1\)).

4. **Select Significance Level (\(\alpha\)):**
   - Common significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, etc.

5. **Find the Critical Value:**
   - The critical value is determined from the Chi-square distribution table for the chosen significance level (\(\alpha\)) and degrees of freedom.
   - The critical value represents the threshold beyond which the null hypothesis will be rejected.

6. **Compare the Chi-square Statistic with the Critical Value:**
   - If the calculated Chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.
   - If the Chi-square statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Example:

Let's say you have observed and expected frequencies for a Chi-square test:

- **Observed Frequencies:** \(O = [10, 20, 30]\)
- **Expected Frequencies:** \(E = [15, 15, 30]\)

### Step 1: Calculate the Chi-square Statistic
\[
\chi^2 = \frac{(10 - 15)^2}{15} + \frac{(20 - 15)^2}{15} + \frac{(30 - 30)^2}{30} = \frac{25}{15} + \frac{25}{15} + \frac{0}{30} = \frac{50}{15} = 3.33
\]

### Step 2: Determine Degrees of Freedom
- \(df = 3 - 1 = 2\)

### Step 3: Select Significance Level
- \(\alpha = 0.05\)

### Step 4: Find the Critical Value
Using a Chi-square distribution table or the `chi2.ppf` function in Python, you find the critical value for \(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(df = 2\) is approximately 5.991.

### Step 5: Compare Chi-square Statistic with Critical Value
- Calculated Chi-square statistic: 3.33
- Critical value at \(\alpha = 0.05\) and \(df = 2\): 5.991

Since 3.33 < 5.991, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Conclusion:
The critical value serves as a threshold in the Chi-square test. If the Chi-square statistic exceeds this value, it suggests that the observed data is significantly different from the expected data, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. If the Chi-square statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, it suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
